# Payday 2 Mod Issues Fix

(This works for Arch and Manjaro. But you should know it by now, dont ya?)

This is a simple script for Arch Linux users that want to mod Payday2 with SuperBLT. This solves problems with the libcurl :)
What this script does is basically copy libcurl from /usr/lib to the Steam executable path. 

A simple script for my first git thing :)

I FORGOT TO SAY:

if you dont have libcurl 4.6.0, it will not work at first glance. you'll have to modify the script by changing the libcurl.4.X.0 in the script.
it's pretty easy, so dont worry :)
